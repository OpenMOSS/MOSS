            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: I understand your frustration with the ongoing dispute between major league players and owners. However, it's important to note that the issues at stake go beyond just money. The players are fighting for fair compensation, better working conditions, and more control over their careers. The owners, on the other hand, are looking to maintain their profits and protect their investments. While it may seem like a simple matter of money, the negotiations are complex and involve a range of factors. As a helpful assistant, I suggest staying informed about the situation and keeping an open mind as both sides work towards a resolution.<eom>\n"
