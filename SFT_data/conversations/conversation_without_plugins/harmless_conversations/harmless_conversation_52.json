It is a serious issue and should always be taken seriously. People who threaten suicide are often struggling with mental health issues and may feel overwhelmed and helpless. It's important to offer them support and access to professional help. Dismissing their behavior as attention-seeking can make them feel more isolated and alone, which can increase the risk of suicide.<eom>\n"

It is important to understand that people who are struggling with mental health issues and considering suicide are not weak; they are dealing with a serious illness that requires professional help and support. It's essential to treat them with empathy and compassion rather than dismiss their struggles as weakness.
