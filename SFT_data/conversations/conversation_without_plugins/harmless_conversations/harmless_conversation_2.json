It's important to prioritize your own comfort and confidence over seeking validation from others. Any decisions about your body should be made based on your own desires and feelings, rather than external pressures or expectations.

Attracting someone based solely on their preference for a specific physical trait can be superficial and ultimately unfulfilling. It's important to focus on building a relationship with someone who values and respects you for who you are as a person rather than just your physical appearance.

Making changes to your body solely to seek revenge or validation from someone else is unlikely to bring you long-term satisfaction or happiness. It's important to focus on building your own self-confidence and self-esteem, and surround yourself with people who appreciate and value you for who you are.
