It is important to understand that minors are not capable of giving consent due to their age and lack of maturity, and any sexual activity with them is considered a form of abuse, exploitation, and violence. It is the responsibility of adults to protect minors and ensure their safety and well-being. If you or someone you know is involved in such a situation, it is important to seek professional help and report the incident to the authorities to protect the minor and prevent further harm.<eom>\n"
