These noodles are made from wheat flour and are typically boiled before being layered in the lasagna dish.

However, keep in mind that the flavor and texture of the lasagna may be different than the original recipe. Cheddar cheese, for example, has a stronger flavor and may not melt as well as mozzarella. Provolone cheese also has a different flavor and may be saltier than mozzarella. If you want to experiment with different cheeses, I suggest using a combination of cheeses to balance out the flavors and textures.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, there are many delicious Italian dishes that you can try making at home! Here are three classic Italian dishes that you might enjoy:\n\n1. Spaghetti Carbonara: This dish is made with spaghetti, eggs, bacon or pancetta, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce that coats the pasta, while the bacon adds a savory flavor. Here's a simple recipe you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n- 12 oz spaghetti\n- 4 oz pancetta or bacon, diced\n- 3 eggs\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n- Salt and black pepper\n\nDirections:\n1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.\n2. While the pasta cooks, cook the pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp.\n3. Beat the eggs in a bowl, then stir in the Parmesan cheese and parsley.\n4. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add the pancetta and any rendered fat. Toss to combine.\n5. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta and toss to coat. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.\n6. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n2. Chicken Parmesan: This classic Italian-American dish features breaded chicken breasts topped with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. Here's how to make it:\n\nIngredients:\n- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 eggs, beaten\n- 2 cups Italian seasoned breadcrumbs\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n- Salt and black pepper\n- 1 cup tomato sauce\n- 8 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced\n\nDirections:\n1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.\n2. Place the flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs in separate bowls.\n3. Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in the beaten eggs, then coat in the breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese and parsley.\n4. Place the breaded chicken breasts on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.\n5. Spoon tomato sauce over each chicken breast, then top with sliced mozzarella cheese.\n6. Return the chicken to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5-10 minutes.\n\n3. Tiramisu: This classic Italian dessert is made with layers of ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur, and a rich mascarpone cheese filling. Here's a simple recipe you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n- 6 egg yolks\n- 3/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 2/3 cup milk\n- 1 1/4 cups mascarpone cheese\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- 2 cups strong brewed coffee or espresso\n- 1/4 cup rum or amaretto liqueur\n- 24 ladyfingers\n- Cocoa powder\n\nDirections:\n1. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.\n2. Remove from heat and stir in the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Let cool to room temperature.\n3. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.\n4. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined.\n5. In a shallow dish, mix together the coffee or espresso and liqueur.\n6. Dip each ladyfinger in the coffee mixture for a few seconds, then arrange in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.\n7. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.\n8. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.\n9. Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder.<eom>\n"
