Use semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> to give meaning to the content of your web page.\n\n2. Provide alternative text for images using the alt attribute. This helps users with visual impairments to understand the content of the image.\n\n3. Use descriptive and concise text for links. Avoid using generic phrases like \"click here\" or \"read more\". Instead, use descriptive phrases that indicate where the link leads to.\n\n4. Use proper heading hierarchy.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Yes, here's how to use responsive images in HTML:\n\n1. Use the <img> tag to insert images into your HTML code.\n\n2. Use the \"srcset\" attribute to specify multiple image sources at different resolutions. The browser will choose the best image source based on the device's screen size.\n\n3. Use the \"sizes\" attribute to define the width of the image at different viewport sizes. This helps the browser to choose the correct image source.\n\n4. Use the \"alt\" attribute to provide alternative text for the image.\n\nHere's an example of how to use responsive images in HTML:\n\n```\n<img src=\"sample.jpg\"\n     srcset=\"sample-400.jpg 400w,\n             sample-800.jpg 800w,\n             sample-1200.jpg 1200w\"\n     sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw,\n            (max-width: 800px) 50vw,\n            1200px\"\n     alt=\"A sample image\">\n```\n\nIn this example, we are specifying three different image sources, each with a different width: 400 pixels, 800 pixels, and 1200 pixels. We are also using the \"sizes\" attribute to define the width of the image at different viewport sizes. The browser will choose the best image source based on the device's screen size.\n\nBy using responsive images in your HTML code, you can ensure that your images look good on all devices and reduce the load time of your website on mobile devices.<eom>\n"
