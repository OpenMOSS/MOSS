The consequences of the Korean War on the political and economic landscape of the Korean peninsula were significant. South Korea's economic development in the first eight years after the war was hindered by political upheavals and pervasive corruption. The two Korean states were separate for some time, while attempting to separate economics from politics in pursuit of openings to Pyongyang. However, the motivations of North Korean diplomacy remain speculative.<eom>\n"
