One of the main differences is the sauces used in cooking. French cuisine traditionally uses historical sauces like veloute, hollandaise, and béchamel, and recipes for these sauces are set in stone. In contrast, Italian cuisine typically makes sauce from stock instead of using pre-set recipes for sauces.  <sup><|1|></sup><eom>\n"
