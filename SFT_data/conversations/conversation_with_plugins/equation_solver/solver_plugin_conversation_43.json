            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: The answer was obtained from solving the system of equations x + y = 56 and x - y = 26. We can first use the second equation to isolate x: x = y + 26. Then we substitute this expression for x into the first equation: (y + 26) + y = 56. Simplifying this equation gives 2y + 26 = 56, which implies 2y = 30 and y = 15. Plugging this value for y back into the equation x = y + 26 gives x = 41. Therefore, the two numbers are 41 and 15.<eot>\n",
