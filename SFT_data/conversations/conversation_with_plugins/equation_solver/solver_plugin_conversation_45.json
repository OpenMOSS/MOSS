            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem related to a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this. The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Thus, we can write the equation as a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides. We have c = 10 and a = 6. We can solve for b.<eot>\n",

Solving for b, we get two possible solutions: b = 8 cm<sup><|1|></sup> or b = -8 cm, but since length cannot be negative, the length of the third side is 8 cm<sup><|1|></sup>.<eom>\n"
